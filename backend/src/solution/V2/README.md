The problem is quite challenging. I am uncertain if I can find a solution that accurately determines the maximum profit. Therefore, I will attempt to simplify the challenge initially to find a suitable initial solution.

## Though process

1. Firstly, it appears natural to assume that the maximum price of an action corresponds to the sell price, while the minimum price represents the buy price. The challenge does not specify any constraints regarding this, and it seems unlikely that there would be a scenario where buying at the maximum price or selling at the minimum price would be a good idea.

2. By examining a much simpler use case involving only one action, we can establish a foundation for solving this specific problem and subsequently simplify the one at hand.

3. In fact, in the case where we have only one action, we can find a highly effective solution by following a simple logic: buying the maximum amount possible during local lows and selling everything during local highs. While there may be some cases where this approach does not yield the optimal solution, it serves as a very efficient heuristic.

4. We can have confidence in finding an optimal solution by following these rules:

   - Filter the initial data to include only the local minima and local maxima of both shares.
   - At a local maximum of a share, we have two options: either sell all the stocks or take no action.
   - At a local minimum, we assume that we will buy the maximum number of shares possible, which will generate the maximum profit in the future.

5. Additionally, we will continue exploring and refining more rules as we progress.
